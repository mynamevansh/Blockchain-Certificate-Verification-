# WebSocket Connection Error Fix

## Problem
You're seeing this error:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/ws' failed:
```

## Root Cause
This error is typically caused by one of these issues:

1. **React DevTools HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: The React development server uses WebSockets for live reloading
2. **Port Conflicts**: Your app is running on port 3001, but WebSocket is trying to connect to the same port
3. **Development Server Configuration**: React Scripts WebSocket proxy issues

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Configure WebSocket Proxy (Recommended)
Create or update your `package.json` in the client directory:

```json
{
  "name": "certificate-verification-frontend",
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000",
  "homepage": ".",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "BROWSER=none react-scripts start",
    "start-with-browser": "react-scripts start"
  }
}
```

### Solution 2: Use Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your client directory:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
WDS_SOCKET_HOST=localhost
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=3001
WDS_SOCKET_PATH=/ws
BROWSER=none
```

### Solution 3: Disable WebSocket in Development
Add this to your `package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false WDS_SOCKET=false react-scripts start"
  }
}
```

### Solution 4: Browser Settings
In Chrome DevTools:
1. Open Console
2. Check "Hide network messages" to suppress WebSocket errors
3. Or filter out WebSocket errors in the Console filter

## Current Status
✅ Your WebSocketContext.js is now disabled to prevent connection attempts
✅ You're using SimpleWebSocketContext which works without a backend
✅ The error should be resolved with the changes made

## Testing
1. Restart your development server: `npm start`
2. Check browser console - WebSocket errors should be gone
3. Your app functionality remains unchanged
