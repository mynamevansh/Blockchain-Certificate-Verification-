# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

This project is configured for seamless deployment on Vercel.

### Prerequisites
- Vercel account
- GitHub repository connected to Vercel

### Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Your Repository**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   The following settings are auto-detected from `vercel.json`:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `client/build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install --prefix client`

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional for frontend-only deployment)
   Add these in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables:
   ```
   CI=false
   REACT_APP_API_URL=your-backend-url (if you have one)
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete
   - Your app will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Important Configuration Files

- **`vercel.json`**: Main Vercel configuration
- **`.vercelignore`**: Files excluded from deployment
- **`client/package.json`**: Build scripts
- **`package.json`**: Root package.json with build commands

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails with "CI variable"
- Solution: Already fixed in `vercel.json` with `CI: false` environment variable

#### 404 Errors on Page Refresh
- Solution: Already fixed with rewrite rules in `vercel.json`

#### Import/Module Errors
- Check all import paths are correct and use correct casing
- Ensure all dependencies are in `client/package.json`

### Local Testing

Test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

### Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:
1. Test all routes work correctly
2. Verify authentication flows
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Test on mobile devices

### Continuous Deployment

Every push to your `main` branch will trigger automatic deployment.

## Support

For issues, check:
- Vercel deployment logs
- Browser console
- Network tab in DevTools
